// The value of Js variable can be changed during the execution of a program because Js is an dhynamic language.
// Example :-
var a = 67;
console.log(a);
var a = "harry";
console.log(a);
// variable is determined only during runtime.

// Var, const and let both are used as to determine and identifier.

var a = "this"
{
var a =26
console.log(a)
}
console.log(a)

let a = "this"
{
let a =26
console.log(a)
}
console.log(a)
